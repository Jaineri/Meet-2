Lost Inside My Mind

My mind always wanders, lost in a haze,
Daydreaming frequently, in a blissful maze.
I am getting older, time slips away,
Will be alone eventually, come what may.

Daydreams paint pictures, vivid and bright,
Of worlds unknown, filled with wonder and light.
A solace I seek, a peaceful retreat,
From the noise of the world, a quiet retreat.

Wrinkles deepen, hair turns gray,
Youthful vigor fades each passing day.
A bittersweet journey, a winding road,
Embracing the future, letting go of the load.
